# MergeSort in LUA

## What is this?
[My favorite sorting algorithm.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort#Merge_sort_with_parallel_recursion)

## Why? 
I needed to learn LUA to assemble a couple of scripts for a scene I was making in coppeliaSim for my final thesis. 

Implementing MergeSort seemed a fun and good way to figure out some of the most common traps of this language, to get familiar with its sintaxis and fill my Github account. Three birds, one stone. 

## How do I run it?

You will need to install a LUA interpreter for your platform, clone this repo and run:
```
lua ./main.lua
```

## What I learned. 
- LUA programming language basics. 
- MergeSort
